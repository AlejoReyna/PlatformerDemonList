                <p><em>(Note: this is still a very early/amateur version of the guidelines, and there will likely be significant changes)</em></p>

                <p><strong>Do levels adhere to standards?</strong></p>
                <p>Rated levels automatically make the list, but for unrated levels, there's an assessment process. The list actively discourages spam-oriented levels, so levels must adhere to a 10 clicks-per-second cap. This applies to a single input; for example, 6 clicks per second on two keys simultaneously (such as left + right) is still acceptable, even though it totals 12 clicks per second cumulatively. Levels relying on random triggers or employing "luck" for difficulty would also be disqualified in most cases.</p>

                <p><strong>Prohibited hacks/exploits</strong></p>
                <p>Here's a current list of unacceptable hacks that will result in your record being rejected:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Noclip</li>
                    <li>Speed hacks</li>
                    <li>Show hitboxes</li>
                    <li>Hitbox multiplier</li>
                    <li>Show layout</li>
                    <li>No spikes</li>
                    <li>No hitboxes</li>
                    <li>Show trajectory</li>
                    <li>Bots/Macros</li>
                    <li>Pause countdown</li>
                    <li>Nerfing levels</li>
                    <li>Frame stepper</li>
                    <li>No mirror</li>
                    <li>No rotation</li>
                    <li>Swiftclick shortcut</li>
                    <li>Instant complete</li>
                    <li>Autoing</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Miscellaneous levels</strong></p>
                <p>Various levels like boss fights/minigames will have their own distinct categories since they differ significantly from typical platformers. This differentiation aims to prevent inaccuracies and difficulty in ordering the list.</p>

                <p><strong>Winners' rankings</strong></p>
                <p>For a given list level, there will be two separate recordsâ€”one ordered by the date of completion and the other ordered by completion time (with the fastest completion at the top).</p>

                <p><strong>How do I submit a completion?</strong></p>
                <p>Submissions are made through our Discord server, and you must include raw footage with recorded clicks. If the level has checkpoints, you can also upload a spliced completion, but raw footage must be shared upon request.</p>
